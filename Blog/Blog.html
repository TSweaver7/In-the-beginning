            <h2>A Blog About Me</h2>
            <p>Published on October 9, 2023</p>
            <p>Hello my name is Tyler Weaver and this blog is about me and my life. I graduated from Kaufman High School and I attended Commerce my freshman year of college. After two semesters I transferred to Blinn college for one semester. After the one semester I left Blinn and took a couuple years off until I decided to come back to Commerce to finish out my degree. I spend most of my time on my computer I built myself which ultimately led me to pursue a computer degree. I currently work fulltime at TAMKO while I pursue said degree.</p>
